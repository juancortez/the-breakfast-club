        Dear Father in heaven,
        <br />
        Thank You for being so passionate about my life for Your glory even when I have been indifferent to You. Thank You for bringing me closer and closer to
        Your heart and Your priorities. Forgive me for the times I have allowed lesser things to conflict with what matters most and lasts longest. Give me
        wisdom as I seek today to bring greater urgency to Your agenda for my marriage and family’s future. Please continue this work in my life so that I am
        daily being prepared for what You already know I will face in the future with Your help. In Jesus’ name, amen.
